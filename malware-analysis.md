Malware Behavior Analysis

Comprehensive static and dynamic analysis of a malicious Windows executable to identify behavioral characteristics, persistence mechanisms, system
modifications, and indicators of compromise (IOCs). The analysis was performed in a controlled sandbox environment to safely observe runtime behavior and network activity.

Objectives

Conduct structured static analysis to examine file metadata, PE structure, imports, and embedded resources.

Execute the sample in an isolated sandbox to observe runtime behavior.

Identify IOCs including file system changes, registry modifications, and network beacons.

Document behavioral patterns relevant to malware classification and incident response.

Produce actionable intelligence suitable for SOC detection and threat hunting.

Methodology
1. Static Analysis

Performed file-level inspection before execution:

Examined PE header and imported libraries to infer functionality.

Identified suspicious API calls related to networking, process injection, and persistence (e.g., CreateRemoteThread, WinInet, RegSetValueEx).

Scanned for embedded strings indicating potential C2 domains, URLs, mutex names, or dropped file paths.

Calculated cryptographic hashes (MD5/SHA256) for IOC generation and sample tracking.

2. Dynamic Analysis

Executed the sample in a fully isolated sandbox environment (Any.Run) to capture real-time behavior:

Monitored process tree creation and inter-process communication.

Observed network traffic to detect C2 beacons, DNS requests, HTTP traffic, or suspicious outbound communication.

Logged file system modifications including created, deleted, or modified files.

Captured registry changes associated with persistence mechanisms (e.g., Run keys).

Analyzed loaded DLLs and runtime indicators of code injection or hollowing.

Tools & Techniques

Dynamic sandbox execution (Any.Run)

PE analysis (PE viewer / static tools)

String extraction (static IOC detection)

Behavioral observation (process activity, registry, filesystem)

Network monitoring (HTTP/DNS beacon analysis)

IOC documentation (file hashes, paths, registry keys, network indicators)

Key Findings

Extracted multiple IOCs including network beacons, malicious file paths, and registry persistence entries.

Observed creation of secondary processes used for privilege escalation or stealth.

Identified suspicious outbound connections consistent with initial C2 communication.

Detected dynamic code injection behaviors via anomalous process handles and loaded modules.

Documented behavioral indicators aligning with known malware families based on tactics and sequences observed.

Summary

This analysis provided a complete behavioral profile of the malware sample, revealing capabilities related to persistence, reconnaissance, and command-and-control
communication. Extracted IOCs enable SOC teams to build detection rules, refine alert triage, and support broader threat hunting activities.

This is an academic malware analysis. All sample identifiers and sensitive details have been intentionally removed.
