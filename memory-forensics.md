🧠 Memory Forensics & Incident Investigation

Analysis of a compromised Windows workstation using Volatility to identify malicious processes, reconstruct attack activity, and extract actionable indicators of compromise (IOCs).

🎯 Objectives

Perform process enumeration and artifact extraction from a memory image

Identify malicious PIDs and suspicious parent–child process chains

Extract C2 communication indicators

Reconstruct an incident timeline from memory artifacts

🛠️ Techniques & Tools

Volatility: pslist, pstree, netscan, dlllist, cmdline, handles

IOC Extraction

Process Enumeration & Artifact Reconstruction

🔑 Key Findings

Discovered malware processes establishing outbound C2 connections

Identified injected modules and suspicious loaded DLLs

Mapped attacker behavior across processes, memory objects, and network traces
